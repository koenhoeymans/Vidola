Transformation test
-------------------

A regular paragraph with *bold* and _italic_ text in. It is followed by a list:

* item, with *bolded* text
* item

!note
	A note can span
multiple lines. It can contain a [[http://link]]. Let's create a note in a note:

	!note
		a subnote with a list

		* item
		* item

	And now we're in our parent note again.

!note
	A note following a note.

 * Item, with _italic_ text and a paragraph.

   The next paragraph in this item.

 * item, with a [link reference] [1]
 * other [link reference] [2]

!note
	A note starting unindented. With a [relative] [3] link.

A code example. It can be used to display code:

	CODE:
		CODE:
			<?php // code goes here ?>

Code inline uses ´backticks´ but...

	~~~
		code can also use tildes and display html
		todo
	~~~

Let's try a short definition list:

term A:
	First paragraph of explanation of term.

	Second paragraph of explanation of term.

term B:
	explanation of term

	* listitem in term B
	* other listitem

This is another paragraph with an [email link] [mail@example.com].

Let's end with code indented:

	code example

The link definitions below disappear.

	[1]: http://www.example.com
	[2]: http://example.com "title"
	[3]: Foo/Bar.html
