Transformation test
-------------------

A regular paragraph with *bold* and _italic_ text in. It is followed by a list:

	* item, with *bolded* text
	* item

	NOTE: A note can span
	multiple lines. It can contain a [[http://link]]. Let's create a note in a note:

		NOTE: a subnote.

		And now we're in our parent note again.

	NOTE: A note following a note.

	* item, with _italic_ text
	* item, with a [link reference] [1]
	* other [link reference] [2]

NOTE: A note starting unindented. With a [relative] [3] link.

A code example is also indented. It can be used to display code:

	CODE:
		CODE:
		<?php // code goes here ?>

Code inline uses ´backticks´.

Let's try a short definition list:

term A
	explanation of term

term B
	explanation of term

This is another paragraph with an [email link] [mail@example.com].

	[1]: http://www.example.com
	[2]: http://example.com "title"
	[3]: Foo/Bar.html
