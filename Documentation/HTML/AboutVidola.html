<doc><h1>What is Vidola?</h1>

<p>Vidola is a documentation markup language. It is designed to make end-user documentation 
as natural as possible. The reason for yet another markup language 
is that none of the others satisfied how I wanted to document. Eg DocBook has 
a lot of options but writing documentation for the web with it is unnatural. Markdown 
is more intuitive and natural but has limitations for creating multi-page documents.</p>
