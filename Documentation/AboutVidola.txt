What is Vidola?
===============

Vidola is a library that transform [Markdown-based](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
documentation to HTML. It is designed to make end-user documentation
as natural as possible.

Why use Vidola
==============

Why would someone use Vidola to create documentation when one can do this
directly in HTML?

 *	Writing about code means using a lot of characters that HTML can't handle
 	directly. Eg every `<` needs to be written as `&lt;`. With Vidola you
 	don't need to worry about that. With Vidola you can write

 		Use `<?php echo $a; ?>` in your template.
 	
 	whereas with HTML this would be
 	
 		Use <code>&lt;?php echo $a; ?&gt;</code>
 	
 *	Writing lists in HTML is annoying. Writing lists with Vidola makes you
 	happy and sing Disney songs. Compare a nested list in HTML

		<ul>
			<li>an item</li>
			<li>other item</li>
			<li>oh no a sublist
				<ul>
					<li>a sublist item</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	versus one created with Vidola

		* already a list item
		* another one because it's so easy
		* let's create a sublist with favorite Muppet Show characters
		
			* Kermit
			* Gonzo the Great
			* Beauregard
			* Rizzo
			* just can't stop writing lists with Vidola

 *	Vidola is much more readable in raw format. Look at the lists above for
 	an example.
 *	Makes you focus on the content. No worrying about tags or having them in
 	your way when rereading your sentence. Just the content.
