What is Vidola?
---------------

Vidola is

 *	a documentation markup language based on
	[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
	It is designed to make end-user documentation as natural as possible.
	Vidola extends Markdown to provide a way to interconnect different pages.
 *	a library to transform above mentioned markup language to documentation
	for your projects providing templates so you can alter the output
	to your liking.

The above combination makes writing documentation for your projects feel
more natural.
