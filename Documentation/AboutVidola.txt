What is Vidola?
===============

Vidola is

 *	a documentation markup language based on
	[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
	It is designed to make end-user documentation as natural as possible.
	Vidola extends Markdown to provide a way to interconnect different pages.
 *	a library to transform above mentioned markup language to documentation
	for your projects providing templates so you can alter the output
	to your liking.

The above combination makes writing documentation for your projects feel
more natural.

Why use Vidola
==============

Why would someone use Vidola to create documentation when one can do this
directly in HTML?

 *	Writing about code means using a lot of characters that HTML can't handle
 	directly. Eg every `<` needs to be written as `&lt;`. With Vidola you
 	don't need to worry about that. With Vidola you can write

 		Use `<?php echo $a; ?>` in your template.
 	
 	whereas with HTML this would be
 	
 		Use <code>&lt;?php echo $a; ?&gt;</code>
 	
 *	Writing lists in HTML is annoying. Writing lists with Vidola makes you
 	happy and sing Disney songs. Compare a nested list in HTML

		<ul>
			<li>an item</li>
			<li>other item</li>
			<li>oh no a sublist
				<ul>
					<li>a sublist item</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	versus one created with Vidola

		* already a list item
		* another one because it's so easy
		* let's create a sublist with favorite Muppet Show characters
		
			* Kermit
			* Gonzo the Great
			* Beauregard
			* Rizzo
			* just can't stop writing lists with Vidola

 *	Vidola is much more readable in raw format. Look at the lists above for
 	an example.
 *	Makes you focus on the content. No worrying about tags or having them in
 	your way when rereading your sentence. Just the content.
