Vidola syntax
-------------

Vidola relies on [AnyMark](https://github.com/koenhoeymans/AnyMark) to provide basic
Markdown features. Vidola adds a way to interconnect documents through a table
of contents.


Table of contents
=================

You can create a table of contents and have it filled automatically with
the headers that follow. It takes all headers and displays a nested list
stopping at the end of the document or when it encounters a header at a
higher level of the first one encountered. Optionally you can specify the
depth.

		{table of contents}
			depth: 2

			about
			introduction

		a header
		========

		A paragraph.

The example above creates a table of contents of the current document, the about document
and the introduction document with all top-level headers found and their immediate
subheaders.

There's also the possibility to add custom page titles.

	{table of contents}

		custom title <page>

This follows Sphinx convention.
