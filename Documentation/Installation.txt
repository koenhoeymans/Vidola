Installation
------------

The simplest way to install Vidola is through Composer. If you already
know how to use it, the only thing required is a
`composer.json` file with the following piece of information:

	{
		"require": {
			"vidola/vidola": "0.2.*"
		}
	}

If you don't know about Composer already you might want to read
an [introduction](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

Optionally you can install Vidola by downloading it from [github]
(https://github.com/koenhoeymans/Vidola/tags). There's an autoloader
that needs to be included in your project:

	require_once __DIR__
		. DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'to'
		. DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'Vidola'
		. DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'Autoload.php';

Vidola depends on two other libraries so if you want to do a manual
install you'll have to install these too. The two libraries Vidola
depends on are [Fjor](https://github.com/koenhoeymans/Fjor) and [AnyMark]
(https://github.com/koenhoeymans/AnyMark).
