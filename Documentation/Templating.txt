Templating
----------

You can write your own templates or adapt the existing default one. Use the
command line option `--template=<template path>` to point Vidola to your
custom template.

In your template the variable `$document` is available. Here we'll discuss
the available methods. You can use them in your template as follows:

	$document->previousPageTitle();


Available methods
=================

 *	`currentPageContent()`
 
 	The parsed content of the current page in the documentation.
 
 *	`currentPageTitle()`
 
 	The title of the current page. It is based on the first header that is
 	found.
