Extending Vidola
----------------

Creating plugins
================

Vidola can be extended by using or creating plugins (or extensions,
which I use synonymously).

A plugin should extend `Vidola\Plugin\Plugin` and implement the
one abstract method `register(EventMapper $mapper)`. The EventMapper
allows your plugin (or registered class of a plugin) to register
for an event and define a callback. A sample plugin could look like this:

	class MySamplePlugin extends \Vidola\Plugin\Plugin {
		public function register(\Vidola\Plugin\EventMapper $eventMapper) {
			$callback = function (\Vidola\Events\AfterParsing $event) {
				$this->handleEvent($event);
			};
			$eventMapper->register('Vidola\\Events\\AfterParsing', $callback);
		}

		public function handleEvent(\Vidola\Events\AfterParsing $event) {
			// do your stuff
		}
	}

The event is a small object that is passed into the callback and contains
the necessary information or objects.

Available events
================

The events can be found in the Event subdirectory.
