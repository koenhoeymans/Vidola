options on the command line
===========================

Run Vidola with `php RunVidola.php` on the command line. The following
options are present:

*	`--template=<template path>`

	Path to a template file. If not specified the default template is used.
	Example:
 
 		--template=/home/Koen/Vidola/Templates/Default.php

*	`--source=<source file>`

	Source file to convert.
	Example:

		--source=/home/Koen/MyProject/Docs/Index.txt

*	`--target-dir=<output directory>`

	The directory where the documentation files should be placed. Vidola tries to create
	it if it doesn't exist.
	Example:

		--source=/home/Koen/MyProject/Docs/HTML/

*	`--internal-links=<internal link builder>`

	Internal links to the generated documentation can follow specified formats. The
	default one is that links have '.html' as extension added, unless an extension
	was already specified. Eg a link to your internal page 'About' will become 'About.html'
	but a link to 'style.css' will be kept 'style.css'. Custom link builders
	can be added by implementing `Vidola\Util\InternalUrlBuilder` and specifying the
	class as an option here.

Using a build file
==================

Alternatively a 'build' file can be specified:

	php RunVidola.php /path/to/build.php

This is a PHP file that returns an array
with key-value pairs that are the same as the above command line options. Minimally
a source and target need to be specified. An example file could be `build.php`
somewhere in your project that contains the following:

	<?php
	
	return array(
		'source'			=> '/home/Bruce/MyDoc/index.txt',
		'target-dir'		=> '/home/Bruce/MySite',
	);

This array can also specify files or directories to copy. These are files contained
within the template directory. Eg. if you use a template like the one that comes with
Vidola you'll probably want the css directory copied automatically too. This is
done by adding it to the build file:

	<?php

	return array(
		'source'			=> '/home/Bruce/MyDoc/index.txt',
		'target-dir'		=> '/home/Bruce/MySiteHtml',
		'template'			=> '/home/Bruce/MyPhpProject/VidolaTemplate/index.php',
		'copy'				=> 'css'
	);

If you need to copy more than one file or directory you can use an array:

	'copy'	=> array('css/style.css', 'header.jpg')

Note that the files or directories to be copied must be specified relative
to the template directory. These pahts are copied back to the target
directory (e.i. the file `css/style.css` will be copied to
`/home/Bruce/MySiteHtml/css/style.css`.

Files and directories can be excluded from being copied by adding the following option:

	'copy-exclude'				=> 'css/dev.css'

The `copy-exclude` key can be a string, specifying one file or directory, or an array.
